Welcome to ReimburseME (ERP) by Michael Jolley.

This is a web app that allows users to request reimbursement for job-related expenses.
Data is persisted in  an amazon RDS, but can be configured to your own database using jdbc in 
com.jolley.utils / ConnectionGenerator
--------------------------------------
This program utilizes the Front Control design pattern headed by the MasertServ.java in the servlets package.
In order to use the program, run the ERP page on a tomcat server and visit the url '_______/me'
If launched from integrated tomcat server url will be http://localhost:8080/me
